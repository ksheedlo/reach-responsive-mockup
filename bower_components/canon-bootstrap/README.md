# canon-bootstrap

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/rackerlabs/canon-bootstrap/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rackerlabs/canon-bootstrap)

**WARNING: Canon Bootstrap is a work-in-progress. This theme is currently
incomplete, and you'll find many Bootstrap components that have not been styled
to match Canon. The API should not be considered stable until v1.0 is released.**

Canon Bootstrap is a theme for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
based on [Canon](http://rackerlabs.github.io/canon/)'s visual design.

## Getting Started

Quickly install canon-bootstrap using Bower:

- bower: `bower install canon-boostrap`

The installed package includes the entire Bootstrap source, Glyphicons, and all
theme-specific customizations. We provide compiled CSS (`canon-boostrap.css`)
along with minified CSS (`canon-boostrap.min.css`).
